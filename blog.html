					<h2 class="blog-title">Cigars Are Weird</h2>
					<p class="blog-text">
						Yesterday I tried my first Cuban cigar. My friend had 3 of those fancy uncut cigars laying around,so we thought it would be a good idea to smoke one. We hadn't smoked anything before, and I mean not even cigarettes or those cheap vape things.<br>
						It is kinda funny because he had those fancy cigars but no cutter, so we had to use the single cutting object in the house, a pair of gardening fucking scissors. Well there was those cheap butter knives laying around too, but we decided it would be better to use the scissors.<br>
						So we cut off the tip of the cigar and got out of his house, with a cheap bic lighter, a mixture of vodka, lemon juice and this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitaya" target="blank">strange looking fruit</a>.<br>
						Then we arrived at <b style="font-size: 1.2vw;">*the spot*</b> and lit up the cigar. Not gonna lie it was pretty hard and I burned my fingers in the process, but once we got it lit up, we started puffing.<br>
						By the way we didn't expect the taste to be like soil or cement or something, not even kidding, afterwards I could swear I licked a wall. But we felt badass ngl. We thought we looked like smoker from one piece.<br>
						Oh and also while we were smoking there, in our "safe spot" some random ass old people kept looking at us from inside their car. So from five to five minutes some random old head would pass by in a car looking at us, and not even fast, they were like 20km/h (muricans are seething) in a busy street, at night. If you are old and are reading this please, stop looking at people smoking at night, It makes them uncofortable<br>
						But anyways we finished the cigar, drank all of the elixir and headed home, after using half a can of deodorant to hide the smell, we then took a shower and I headed home, which in itself was also a funny experience, because public transport, lol.<br>
						After all, it wasnt that mid, we just didn't expect the wood/soil taste of the cigar, and we also had a funny talk on the way back home on how it is impossible to get addicted to something as exotic (for the lack of an appropriate word) as a cigar.<br>
						If you want to try it someday too, make sure to bring deodorant and something for the throat, if you don't want to sound and smell like a crazy military dude or a Cuban. OH AND ALSO Dont inhale the smoke, I'm a dumbass, and tysm louceph for pointing that out to me, you're a massive fucking legend.
